1. The GSL has to be installed.
2. If the headers or library files of the GSL cannot be found in the standard search paths, open "Makefile" contained in the MultiDimGrid root directory, and set the variables "GSL_INCLUDE_PATH" and "GSL_LIB_PATH" to the appropriate paths. Do not modify the rest of the file.
3. Open a terminal in the MultiDimGrid root directory and run "make". This builds MultiDimGrid and generates a library file "libmultidimgrid.a" in the root directory.
4. To use MultiDimGrid in your own code, link your program to "libmultidimgrid.a" as well as the GSL, and include the header file "MultiDimGrid.h".
5. If Doxygen is installed, one can also generate the documentation of MultiDimGrid by running "make doc" in the root directory. Afterwards, the documentation can be found under "doc/documentation.html".
6. A small program demonstrating the usage of MultiDimGrid can be found in the directory "demo". If you modify this, just run "make" in the MultiDimGrid root directory to rebuild it.
